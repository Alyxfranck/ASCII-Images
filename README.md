# Binary Melodies
This is an exploration of randomness in digital art. Using Processing 4, this project converts song lyrics into visual images by translating them into binary and using the binary to create the images. Each program or sketch within this repository works similarly.

## How it works

The programs require a binary data text file as input. This data represents the translated song lyrics or any kind of text. The programs read this binary data from the text file and interpret it to generate a unique visual representation on a canvas. 

The specific mechanism for translating the binary data into visual representation varies by program, but each leverages the inherent structure of the binary data to inform the generated visual.

## Installation

- Install [Processing 4](https://processing.org/download/)
- Clone this [repository](https://github.com/Alyxfranck/Binarymelodies.git)
- Add a binary data text file to the project. You can use [Text to Binary](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html) for this 
- Open the `.pde` file in the Processing IDE and run the sketch

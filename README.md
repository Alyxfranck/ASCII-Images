# Binary Melodies

Binary Melodies is an exploration of randomness in digital art. Using Processing 4, this project converts song lyrics into visual images by translating them into binary and using the binary to create the images. Each program or sketch within this repository works similarly.

## How it works

The programs require a binary data text file as input. This data represents the translated song lyrics. The programs read this binary data from the text file and interpret it to generate a unique visual representation on a canvas. 

The specific mechanism for translating the binary data into visual representation varies by program, but each leverages the inherent structure of the binary data to inform the generated visual.

The output of each program is a grayscale image representing the binary data, saved as a JPEG file.

## Installation

- Install [Processing 4](https://processing.org/download/).
- Clone this repository:[Clone](https://github.com/Alyxfranck/Binarymelodies). 
- Add a binary data text file to the project.
- Open the `.pde` file in the Processing IDE and run the sketch.
